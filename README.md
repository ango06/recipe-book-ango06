# üë®‚Äçüç≥ Cookbook

> **This is a 2 part homework assignment, part 1 is due on 4/7 and part 2 is due on 4/14!**

## üìï Background
Hello Chef! Hack4Impact-UMD Publishers is honored to have the opportunity to publish your first cookbook. We are a reputed publishing company with several well-known titles to our name, such as Brandon's Burritos, Gavin the Speed Typer, and Overcommitted Krishnan.

H4I-UMD Publishers's top priority is ensuring your cookbook reaches as many people as possible. That is why, in addition to print copies, we create **immersive online experiences** to capture those who do not read books. However, our last programmer just ran away! We're also tight on money since our Finance department only dedicates a small amount to our chefs' immersive online experiences.

We heard that you're a coder on the side. This isn't a threat, but if you want your cookbook to gain any traction you should probably help us with this üòÅ
